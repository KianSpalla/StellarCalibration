dynamic_find_stars(img)
PROBELM: when we create a mask using a threshold based on the entire image,
    some stars in brighter areas of the sky, such as the center of the image or nearcity horizons/clouds,
    get drowned out and are not captured by the mask.

SOLUTION: instead of creating a threshold based on the entire image, we can split the image into sections,
    then we take the thresholds of those individual sections to build the mask. 
    This eliminates the variance in overall brightness of different sections, 
    and instead we are choosing stars based on contrast to their respective backgrounds.

NOTE: we dont want to allow too many stars to pass the threshold until we have a better matching methodology as we can easily make false matches

PSEUDO:

        Split image into sections
            per section:
            create mask for section
            call cluster_stars
            add results into labels and numClusters
    
    return labels and numClusters

TODO:
    Somehow implement a way to filter stars by a min and max size. 
    This will help get rid of outliers in noise and objects that are too big to be stars like clouds
